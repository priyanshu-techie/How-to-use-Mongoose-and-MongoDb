# NOTES For Mongoose and MongoDb

Refer these codes and documentation for revising various methods and ways to use mongoose.

In the mongodriver.js i have used the mongoDb driver code to connect to the database. It uses the 'mongoDb' dependency.

But in the mongoose folder, I have used mongoose framework for connecting with my Db. It makes our job a lot easier by handling many things on its own.

### It helps to make the schema of the document to be inserted.
### Also Mongoose model provides an interface to the database for creating, querying, updating, deleting records, etc.
### In simpler terms, a schema is a blueprint for defining the structure of a document while a model is a class with which we construct documents.
