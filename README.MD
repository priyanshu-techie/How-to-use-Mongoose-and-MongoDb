# NOTES For Mongoose and MongoDb

Refer these codes and documentation for revising various methods and ways to use mongoose.

In the mongodriver.js i have used the mongoDb driver code to connect to the database. It uses the 'mongoDb' dependency.

But in the mongoose folder, I have used mongoose framework for connecting with my Db. It makes our job a lot easier by handling many things on its own.

It helps to make the schema of the document to be inserted.
Also makes a Model with it, which is just like a contructor function in JavaScript, which spits out objects when called with a NEW keyword.
